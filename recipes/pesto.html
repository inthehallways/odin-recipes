        <h1>Bacon Pesto Pasta</h1>

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>You’ve heard of chicken or tuna pesto pasta, but what if you're craving for pesto but don't have both? This is how I discovered bacon pesto pasta.</p>
        <p>Turns out, bacon works surprisingly well. Its crispy texture and smoky, salty flavor give the pasta a deeper, more savory edge. Paired with the fresh, herby taste of pesto, it’s a quick fix that doesn’t feel like a compromise—just a solid, flavorful combo that came out of nowhere and now I keep coming back to.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Chopped Bacon <em>(amount is to your liking)</em></li>
            <li>6 cloves garlic</li>
            <li>Butter <em>(adjust to your liking)</em></li>
            <li>180g Clara Ole Cheesy Pesto Sauce</li>
            <li>250mL All Purpose Cream</li>
            <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
            <li>Cheese <em>(optional)</em></li>
            <li>250g Pasta<em>(I used spaghetti for this)</em></li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook your pasta according to package instructions.</li>
            <li>Mince your garlic and set them aside.</li>
            <li>In a pan, cook your bacon depending on how crispy you want it to be. Then, remove some of the rendered fat so it won't be too oily.</li>
            <li>Add butter to the pan and let it melt.</li>
            <li>Add the minced garlic and sauté until fragrant.</li>
            <li>Pour in the Clara Ole Cheesy Pesto Sauce and stir well.</li>
            <li>Pour in the All Purpose Cream and mix until well combined.</li>
            <li>Remember to season the sauce with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
            <li>Add the cooked pasta in the sauce and mix until it is fully incorporated to the sauce.</li>
            <li>Serve hot and top with cheese if desired.</li>
        </ol>
